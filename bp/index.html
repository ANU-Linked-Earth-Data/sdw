    <section id="abstract">
      <p>This document advises on best practices related to the publication and usage of spatial
        data on the Web; the use of Web technologies <em>as they may be applied to location</em>.
        The best practices are intended for practitioners, including Web developers and geospatial
        experts, and are compiled based on evidence of real-world application. These best practices
        suggest a significant change of emphasis from traditional Spatial Data Infrastructures by
        adopting a Linked Data approach. As location is often the common factor across multiple
        datasets, spatial data is an especially useful addition to the Linked Data cloud; the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 Stars of Linked Data</a> paradigm
        is promoted where relevant.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>As a First Public Working Draft, this document is incomplete. The editors seek to
        illustrate the full scope of the best practices- albeit with the details missing at this
        stage. In particular, the <em>examples</em> for each best practice are largely incomplete.
        The editors intend to compile a much richer set of examples in the period leading up to
        publication of the next Working Draft. Feedback is requested on the scope of this document
        and the best practices herein. The editors are particularly keen for reviewers to cite
        examples that may be used to further illustrate these best practices.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter#bp">charter</a> for this deliverable
        states that the best practices will include "<em>an agreed spatial ontology conformant to
          the ISO 19107 abstract model and based on existing available ontologies [...]</em>".
        Rather than creating a new spatial ontology, the editors aim to provide a methodology that
        will help data publishers choose which exisitng spatial ontology is relevant for their
        application. If deemed necesssary to meet the stated requirements (see [[SDW-UCR]]), a new
        spatial ontology, or elements that extend the existing spatial ontologies, will be
        established in subsequent Working Draft releases.</p>
      <p>The editors also intend to provide supplementary methods to navigate through the best
        practices in order to increase the utility of this document. This will be addressed for the
        next Working Draft release.</p>
      <p><strong>For OGC</strong>This is a Public Draft of a document prepared by the Spatial Data
        on the Web Working Group (<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg"
          >SDWWG</a>) - a joint W3C-OGC project (see <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>). The document is prepared
        following W3C conventions. The document is released at this time to solicit public
        comment.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Increasing numbers of Web applications provide a means of accessing data. From simple visualisations to sophisticated interactive tools, there is a growing reliance on data. The open data movement has lead to many national, regional and local governments publishing their data through portals. Scientific and cultural heritage data is increasingly published on the Web for reuse by others. Crowd-sourced and social media data are abundant on the Web. Sensors, connected devices and services from domains such as energy, transport, manufacturing and healthcare are becoming commonly integrated using the Web as a common data sharing platform.</p>
      <p>The Data on the Web Best Practices [[DWBP]] provide a set of recommendations that are applicable to the publication of <em>all</em> types of data on the Web. Those best practices cover aspects including data formats, data access, data identifiers, metadata, licensing and provenance.</p>
      <p>Location information, or <a>geospatial data</a>, is often a common thread running through such data; describing how things are positioned relative to the Earth in terms of coordinates and/or topology.</p>
      <p>Within this document our focus is the somewhat broader concern of <a>spatial data</a>; data that describes <em>anything</em> with spatial extent (i.e. size, shape or position) whether or not it is positioned relative to the Earth.</p>
      <p>Similarly to the challenges identified in [[DWBP]] relating to publishing data on the Web, and therefore not making use of the full potential of the Web as a data sharing platform, there is a lack of consistency in how people publish <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
      <p>It is not that there is a lack of spatial data on the Web; the maps, satellite and street level images offered by search engines are familiar and there are many more examples of spatial data being used in Web applications.</p>

      <aside class="example" id="ex-sfpark" title="SFpark"><a href="http://sfpark.org/">SFpark</a> is a Web site where users can look at a map of San Francisco to see where parking is available and at what price. Parking prices are incrementally raised or lowered in SFpark pilot areas based on demand. In this application, static data on existing parking spaces is combined with changing data about where people park the most, which is measured by parking sensors.</aside>

      <p>However, the data that has been published is difficult to find and often problematic to access for non-specialist users. The key problems we are trying to solve in this document are discoverability, accessibility and interoperability. Our overarching goal is to enable spatial data to be integrated within the wider Web of data; providing standard patterns and solution that help solve these problems.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="audience" class="informative">
      <h2>Audience</h2>

      <p>Our goal in writing this best practice document is to support the practitioners who are responsible for publishing their spatial data on the Web or developing tools to make it easy for others to work with spatial data.</p>
      <p>We expect readers to be familiar both with the fundamental concepts of the architecture of the Web [[WEBARCH]] and the generalised best practices related to the publication and usage of data on the Web [[DWBP]].</p>
      <p>We aim to provide two primary pathways into these best practices:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>for those already familiar with publishing data on the Web who want to better exploit the spatial aspects of their data; and</li>
        <li>for those who publish spatial data through Spatial Data Infrastructures and want to better integrate that data within the wider Web ecosystem.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In each case, we aim to help them provide incremental value to their data through application of these best practices.</p>
      <p>This document provides a wide range of examples that illustrate how these best practices may be applied using specific technologies. We do not expect readers to be familiar with all the technologies used herein; rather that readers can identify with the activities being undertaken in the various examples and, in doing so, find relevant technologies that they are already aware of or discover technologies that are new them.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>

      <p>All of the best practices described in [[DWBP]] are relevant to publication of spatial data on the Web. Some, such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DataLicense">Provide data license information</a> need no further elaboration in the context of <a>spatial data</a>. However, other best practices from [[DWBP]] are further refined in this document to provide more specific guidance guidance for <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
      <p>The best practices described below are intended to meet requirements derived from the scenarios in [[SDW-UCR]] that describe how spatial data in commonly published and used on the Web.</p>
      <p>In line with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter#bp">charter</a>, this document provides advice on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The choice of ontology and data format to be used when encoding spatial data;</li>
        <li>The use of URIs for identifiers of resources described in spatial data;</li>
        <li>The use of metadata to complement spatial data; and</li>
        <li>The use of APIs to expose spatial data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Discussion of activities relating to rending geospatial data as maps is explicitly out of scope.</p>
      <p>We extend [[DWBP]] to cover aspects specifically relating to <a>spatial data</a>, introducing new best practices only where necessary. In particular, we consider the individual resources, or <a>Spatial Things</a>, that are described within a dataset.</p>
      <p>We consider a ‘programmable web’, formed by a network of connected services, products, data and devices, each doing what it is good at, to be the future of the Web. So whether we are talking about Big, Crawlable, Linked, Open, Closed, Small, Spatial or Structured Data; our starting point is that it needs to be machine-friendly and developer-friendly: making it as programmable as possible.</p>
      <p>The best practices described in this document are compiled based on evidence of real-world application. Where the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">Working Group</a> have identified issues that inhibit the use or interoperability of spatial data on the Web, yet no evidence of real-world application is available, the editors present these issues to the reader for consideration, along with any approaches recommended by the Working Group. Such recommendations will be clearly distinguished as such in order to ensure that they are not confused with evidence-based best practice.</p>

      <p class="issue" data-number="81">Devise a way to make best versus emerging practices clearly recognizable in this document.</p>

      <p>The normative element of each best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>. Possible implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these recommend the use of a particular technology.</p>
      <p>An end-to-end narrative based around an urban flooding scenario is used to provide context for our examples. We hope that readers are able to identify with the various actors in the scenario, and the activities those actors are undertaking, in order to help identify which best practices and implementation approaches are relevant for their task.</p>
      <p>We intend this best practice to be durable; that is that the best practices remain relevant for many years to come as the specific technologies change. However, in order to provide actionable guidance, i.e. to provide readers with the technical information they need to get their spatial data on the Web, we try to balance between durable advice (that is necessarily general) and examples using currently available technologies that illustrate how these best practices can be implemented. We expect that readers will continue to be able to derive insight from the examples even when those specifically mentioned technologies are no longer in common usage, understanding that technology ‘y’ has replaced technology ‘x’.</p>

    <section id="spatial-things-features-and-geometry">
      <h2>Spatial Things, Features and Geometry</h2>
      <p>In geographic information standards from the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC) and the the 19100 series of ISO geographic information standards from <a href="http://www.isotc211.org">ISO/TC 211</a> the primary entity is the <a>feature</a>. <span style="background-color:yellow">[ISO-19101]</span> defines a feature as an: “abstraction of real world phenomena”.</p>
      <p>This terse definition is a little confusing, so let’s unpack it.</p>
      <p>Firstly, it talks about “real world phenomena”; that’s everything from highways to helicopters, parking meters to postcode areas, water bodies to weather fronts and more. These can be physical things that you can touch (e.g. a phone box) or an abstract concept that has spatial extent (e.g. a postcode area). Features can even be fictional (e.g. “Dickensian London”) and may even lack any concrete location information such as the mythical Atlantis.</p>
      <p>The key point is that these “features” are things that one talks about in the <a>universe of discourse</a> - which is defined in <span style="background-color:yellow">[ISO-19101]</span> as the “view of the real or hypothetical world that includes everything of interest”.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the definition of feature talks about “abstraction”. Take the example of <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q546122">Eddystone Lighthouse</a>. A helicopter pilot might see it a “vertical obstruction” and be interested in attributes such as its height and precise location. Whereas a sailor may see it as a “maritime navigation aid” and need information about its light characteristic and general location. Depending on one’s set of concerns, only a subset of the attributes of a given “real world phenomenon” are relevant. In the case of Eddystone Lighthouse, we defined two separate “abstractions”. As is common practice in many information modelling activities, the common sets of attributes for a given “abstraction” are used to define <em>classes</em>. In the parlance of <span style="background-color:yellow">[ISO-19101]</span>, such a class is known as “feature type”. </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Although the exact semantics differ a little, there is a good correlation between the concept of “feature type” as defined in geographic information standards and the concept of “class” defined in [[RDF-SCHEMA]. The former is an information modelling construct that binds a fixed set of attributes to an identified resource, whereas the latter defines the set of all resources that share the same group of attributes.</p>
        <p>When combined with the <a>open-world assumption</a> embraced by RDF Schema and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]], the set-based approach to classes provides more flexibility when combining information from multiple sources. For example, the “Eddystone Lighthouse” resource can be seen as <em>both</em> a “vertical obstruction” <em>and</em> a “maritime navigation aid” as it meets the criteria for membership of both sets. Conversely, this flexibility makes it much more difficult to build software applications as there is no guarantee that an information resource will specify a given attribute. Web standards such the Shapes Constraint Language [[SHACL]] are being defined to remedy this issue.</p>
      </div>

      <p>However, the term “feature” is also commonly used to mean a capability of a system, application or component. To avoid confusion, we adopt the term “<a>spatial thing</a>” throughout the remainder of this best practice document. “<a>Spatial thing</a>” is defined in <span style="background-color:yellow">[W3C-BASIC-GEO]</span> as “Anything with spatial extent, i.e. size, shape, or position. e.g. people, places, bowling balls, as well as abstract areas like cubes”.</p>
      <p>The term “<a>spatial thing</a>” is considered equivalent to “<a>feature</a>”. Furthermore, we treat it as equivalent to other commonly used definitions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feature</strong>: “A geographical feature, capable of holding spatial relations” <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="http://geovocab.org/doc/neogeo/">NeoGeo</a>]</span></li>
        <li><strong>Location</strong>: “A spatial region or named place” [[DCTERMS]]</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="issue" data-number="tba">
        <p>How do we ensure alignment with the terminology being used in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/Further_development_of_GeoSPARQL">further development of GeoSPARQL</a>? We expect a new spatial ontology to be published which will contain clear and unambiguous definitions for the terms used therein.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Looking more closely, it is important to note that geometry is a property of a <a>spatial thing</a>.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight" id="ex-eddystone-geometry" title="Eddystone Lighthouse geometry (encoded as GeoJSON)">
{ 
  “geometry”: { 
    “type”: “Point”, 
    “coordinates”: [50.184, -4.268] 
  } 
}
      </pre>

      <p>In actual fact, this is only one geometry that may be used to describe Eddystone Lighthouse. Other geometries might include a 2D polygon that defines the footprint of the lighthouse in a horizontal plane and a 3D solid describing the volumetric shape of the lighthouse.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, these geometries may be subject to change due to, say, a resurvey of the lighthouse. In such a situation, the geometry object would be updated- but the <a>spatial thing</a> that we are talking about is still Eddystone Lighthouse. Following the best practices presented below, we use a HTTP URI to unambiguously identify Eddystone Lighthouse: <code><a href="http://d-nb.info/gnd/1067162240">http://d-nb.info/gnd/1067162240</a></code> (URIs sourced from <a href="http://www.dnb.de/DE/Home/home_node.html">Deutsche Nationalbibliothek</a>).</p>
      <p>We say that the <a>spatial thing</a> is disjoint from the geometry object. The <a>spatial thing</a>, Eddystone Lighthouse (<code><a href="http://d-nb.info/gnd/1067162240">http://d-nb.info/gnd/1067162240</a></code>), is the “real world phenomenon” about which we want to state facts (e.g. its focal height is at 41 metres above sea level) and link to other real world phenomena (e.g. it is located at Eddystone Rocks, Cornwall; identified as <code><a href="http://d-nb.info/gnd/1030145318">http://d-nb.info/gnd/1030145318</a></code>).</p>

    </section>
    <section id="spatial-relations">
      <h2>Spatial relations</h2>
      <p>A spatial relation specifies how an object is located in space in relation to a reference object. Commonly used types of spatial relations are: topological, directional and distance relations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Topological relations</em> describe the relationships between geometric objects that are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. As such, topological relations can support qualitative spatial reasoning without reference to the geometries themselves; for example to assert that object A touches object B. These relations, also known as “spatial predicates”, include concepts such as: equals, disjoint, intersects, touches, within, contains, overlaps and crosses.</li>
        <li><em>Directional relations</em> specify the relative direction between object and reference. Examples include: left, in front of and astern.</li>
        <li><em>Distance relations</em> specify how far the object is from the reference object. Examples include: at, nearby and far away.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="issue" data-number="tba">
        <p>Do we also need to talk about spatial relationships? And how they are related to <a>spatial things</a> and geometries?</p>
      </div>

    </section>
    <section id="linked-data">
      <h2>Linked Data</h2>
      <p>The term ‘<a>Linked Data</a>’ refers to an approach to publishing data that puts linking at the heart of the notion of data, and uses the linking technologies provided by the Web to enable the weaving of a global distributed database. By naming real world entities - be they web resources, physical objects such as the Eiffel Tower, or even more abstract things such as relations or concepts - with URLs data can be published and linked in the same way web pages can. [[LDP-PRIMER]]</p>
      <p>The 5-star scheme at <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="http://5stardata.info">5STARDATA</a>]</span> states:</p>
      <p style="text-indent:80px">&#9733; make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format) under an open license</p>
      <p style="text-indent:65px">&#9733;&#9733; make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel instead of image scan of a table)</p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; make it available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g., CSV as well as of Excel)</p>
      <p style="text-indent:35px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff</p>
      <p style="text-indent:20px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; link your data to other data to provide context</p>
      <p>We think that the concept of <a>Linked Data</a> is fundamental to the publishing of spatial data on the Web: it is the <a>links</a> that connect data together that are the foundational to the Web of data.</p>
      <p>In a departure from the approach adopted within typical <a>spatial data infrastructures</a>, these best practices promote a Linked Data approach.</p>
      <p>Sources such as the Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] assert a strong association between Linked Data and the <a>Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF) [[RDF11-PRIMER]]. Yet we believe that Linked Data requires only that the formats used to publish data support Web linking (see [[WEBARCH]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#hypertext">§4.4 Hypertext</a>). <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="http://5stardata.info">5STARDATA</a>]</span> asserts only that data formats be open and non-proprietary (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;); and infers the need for data formats to support use of URIs as identifiers (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;) and Web linking (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;).</p>
      <p>Within this document we include examples that use <a>RDF</a> and related technologies such as <a>triple stores</a> and <a>SPARQL</a> because we see evidence of its use in real world applications that support <a>Linked Data</a>. However, we must make clear to readers that there is no requirement for all publishers of spatial data on the Web to embrace the wider suite of technologies associated with the Semantic Web; we recognise that in many cases, a Web developer has little or no interest in the toolchains associated with Semantic Web due to the addition of complexity to any Web-centric solution.</p>
      <p>Although we think that <a>Linked Data</a> need not necessarily require the use of <a>RDF</a>, it is probably easiest to do so. We note that [[JSON-LD]] provides a bridge between those worlds by providing a data format that is compatible with RDF but relies on standard <a>JSON</a> tooling.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as the examples in this document illustrate, we often see a ‘hybrid’ approach being used in real-world applications; using <a>RDF</a> to work with graphs of information that interlink resources, while relying on other technologies to query and process the spatial aspects of that information for performance reasons.</p>

      <h2>Why are traditional Spatial Data Infrastructures not enough?</h2>
      <p>Finding, accessing and using data disseminated through <a>spatial data infrastructures</a> (SDI) based on <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> web services is difficult for non-expert users. There are several reasons, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In <a>spatial data infrastructures</a>, catalog services are intended to be used for discovering spatial assets, not the general purpose search engines of the Web. <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> web services do not address indexing of their content by those search engines.</li>
        <li>By design, the catalog services only provide access to metadata - and in general metadata that is focussed on the needs of expert users - not the data itself.</li>
        <li>Users cannot just “follow links” to access data, it is typically necessary to construct some kind of query to access data. Often these queries are complex to define, requiring in depth knowledge both of the data structure and the domain-specific query language.</li>
        <li>In addition, it is often difficult for non-expert users to understand and use the data. Part of this are domain-specific complexities that are difficult for non-experts (e.g., handling of coordinates in different coordinate reference systems), but hard to avoid entirely. But the datasets often address requirements of expert communities with diverse needs, resulting in comprehensive, but complex specifications that cover many edge cases, too. And the data is typically available in formats that are not easy to process for non-expert users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, <a>spatial data infrastructures</a> are a key component of the broader <a>spatial data</a> ecosystem. Such infrastructures typically include workflows and tools related to the management and curation of spatial datasets, and provide mechanism to support the rich set of capabilities required by the expert community. Our goal is to help spatial data publishers build on these foundations to enable the spatial data from SDIs to be fully integrated with the Web of data.</p>

        <h3>Spatial Metadata</h3>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing the provision of metadata to support
          discovery and reuse of data (see [[DWBP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#metadata"
            >Metadata</a> for more details). Providing metadata at the <em>dataset</em> level
          supports a mode of discovery well aligned with the practices used in <a>Spatial Data
            Infrastructure</a> (SDI) where a user begins their search for spatial data by submitting
          a query to a catalog. Once the appropriate dataset has been located, the information
          provided by the catalog enables the user to find a service end-point from which to access
          the data itself - which may be as simple as providing a mechanism to download the entire
          dataset for local usage or may provide a rich API enabling the users to request only the
          required parts for their needs. The dataset-level metadata is used by the catalog to match
          the appropriate dataset(s) with the user's query.</p>
        <p>This section includes best practices for including the spatial extent and the CRS of the
          dataset in the metadata. These are the extra metadata items needed to make spatial
          datasets discoverable and reusable. A third best practice in this section helps you go a
          step further: exposing spatial data on the web in such a way that the individual entities
          within the dataset are discoverable. </p>

            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>For spatial data, it is often necessary to describe the spatial details of the
              dataset - such as spatial coverage or extent of the dataset or, put in simpler terms,
              which area of the world the data is about. This information is used, for example, by
                <a>SDI</a> catalog services that offer spatial querying to find data - but also by
              users to understand the nature of the dataset.</p>

            <p>Provide as much spatial metadata as necessary, but at least the spatial coverage.
              Other examples of spatial metadata are: </p>
            <ul>

                  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DescriptiveMetadata">Descriptive Metadata</a>:
                Include the spatial coverage of the features described by the dataset using
                [[vocab-dcat]] and a reference to a named place in a common vocabulary for
                geospatial semantics (e.g. <a
                  href="http://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html">GeoNames</a>), </li>
              <li>Again, use [[vocab-dcat]], but instead of a reference to a named place, use a set
                of coordinates to specify the boundaries of the area either as a bounding box (add
                glossary ref) or a polygon.</li>
              <li>Use the spatial extension of [[vocab-dcat]], <a
                  href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/139283/">GeoDCAT AP</a>, to specify spatial
                attributes that are not available in [[vocab-dcat]].</li>

          <p><span id="ref-crs" class="practicelab">Specify Coordinate Reference System for
              high-precision applications</span></p>
          <p class="practicedesc">A coordinate referencing system (CRS) should be specified for
            high-precision applications to locate geospatial entities.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>The <a>CRS</a> is a special metadata attribute of spatial data that must be known for
              users to judge if the data is usable to them. Clients or users must always be able to
              determine what CRS is used. Sometimes this is determined by the specification of the
              data format that is used, but specifying the CRS as part of the metadata allows
              clients and users to judge if the data is usable, and allows users to find spatial
              data with a specific CRS. </p>
            <p>The choice of CRS is sensitive to the intended domain of application for the
              geospatial data. For the majority of applications a common global CRS (WGS84) is fine,
              but high precision applications (such as precision agriculture and defence) require
              spatial referencing to be accurate to a few meters or even centimeters. Specific,
              highly accurate CRS exist to provide a coordinate system for a specific region of the
              world (often a specific country). Spatial data from France is never going to use the
              Dutch coordinate system and vice versa.</p>
            <p>Different <a>CRS</a> exist mainly because the positions on the surface of the earth
              relative to each other are constantly changing. For example, North America and Europe
              are receding from each other by a couple of centimeters per year, whereas Australia is
              moving several centimeters per year north-eastwards. So, for better than one meter
              accuracy in Europe, the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) was
              devised and it is frequently revised to take account of the drifting European tectonic
              plate. Consequently, coordinates in the ETRS89 system will change by a couple of
              centimetres per year with respect to WGS84.</p>
            <p class="issue" data-number="204">Need to clarify when and why people use different
              CRS's</p>
            <p>Even if a <a>CRS</a>, tied to a tectonic plate, is used, local coordinates in some
              areas may still change over time, if the plate is rotating with respect to the rest of
              the earth. Many existing useful maps pre-date GPS and WGS84 based mapping, so that
              location errors of tens of metres, or more, may exist when compared to the same
              location derived from a different technology, and these errors may vary in size across
              the extent of a single map.</p>
            <p>Another reason why different CRS exist has nothing to do with tectonic drift, but
              with projecting the 3D globe on a flat, 2D map: Cartesian projections. These are
              useful e.g. for calculating areas. </p>
            <p class="note">The misuse of spatial data, because of confusion about the CRS, can
              result in catastrophic results; e.g. both the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
              Belgrade during the Balkan conflict and fatal incidents along the East Timor border
              are generally attributed to spatial referencing problems.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Recommendations about CRS referencing should consider:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If your goal is to make data available to mass-market web users, make it available
                in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS84</a>. This CRS
                is suitable for many applications, but be aware (and perhaps publish) the
                limitations of doing so.</li>
              <li>If your goal is high accuracy, choose the best local CRS for your data.</li>
              <li>Publishing data in multiple CRSs is fine, and may help users to combine your data
                with other sources, as well as serving multiple types of user.</li>
              <li>It is preferable to explicitly state which CRS(s) you are using. For convenience,
                the CRS is often designated within the data format or vocabulary specification (e.g.
                  <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos">W3C WGS84 Geo Positioning
                  vocabulary</a>) and, therefore, does not appear in the data itself. This is often
                considered as a default CRS. Data publishers and consumers should make sure they are
                aware of the specified CRS and any limitations that this may pose regarding the use
                of the data.</li>
              <li>Where a specific CRS is required, the data publisher should choose a vocabulary
                where the CRS can be defined explicitly within the data.</li>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>This best practice goes one step beyond metadata as an way to make datasets
              discoverable. Current <a>SDI</a> approaches require a 2-step approach for discovery,
              beginning with a catalog query and then accessing the appropriate data service
              end-point. However, one of the criteria for exposing data <em>on the Web</em> is that
              it can be discovered directly using search engines such as <a
                href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>
              and <a href="https://www.yandex.com/">Yandex</a>, or other services such as
              ‘sameAs.org’ (which harvests links) and HyperCat. Current <a>SDI</a> approaches treat
              spatial data much like books in a library where you must first use the librarian's
              card catalog index to find the book on the shelf. As for other types of data on the
              Web, we want to be able to find spatial resources directly; we want to move beyond the
              two-step discovery approach of contemporary <a>SDIs</a> and find the words, sentences
              and chapters in a book without needing to check the card catalog first. Not only will
              this make spatial data far more accessible, it mitigates the problems caused when
              catalogs have only stale dataset metadata and removes the need for data users to be
              proficient with the query protocol of the dataset's service end-point in order to
              acquire the data they need.</p>
            <p>Exposing data <em>on the Web</em> means that it can be discovered directly using
              search engines. This doesn't mean metadata is no longer necessary; it is still needed
              for clients and users to judge the usability of the data for their purposes. But
              exposing data on the web provides a number of benefits:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spatial data will become far more discoverable because a user does not need any

        <h3>Spatial Data Quality</h3>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides a best practice discussing how the quality of data on the web should be
          described (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality">Data Quality</a> for
          more details). This section is based on the Data Quality section from [[DWBP]] and adds a
          Best Practice specific for spatial data.</p>
        <p>In the Spatial Metadata section we provided a <a href="#ref-crs">Best Practice</a> on how
          to deal with CRS in spatial data on the web. There is also a clear link between CRS and
          data quality, because the accuracy of spatial data depends for a large part on the CRS
          used. This can be seen as conformance of data with a "standard" - in this case, a (spatial
          or temporal) reference system. This is how you can describe spatial data quality using
          different vocabularies. We will provide an example in this section. </p>
        <div class="practice">

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>The amount of detail that is provided in spatial data and the resolution of the data
              can vary. No measurement system is infinitely precise and in some cases the spatial
              data can be intentionally generalized (e.g. merging entities, reducing the details,
              and aggregation of the data) [[Veregin]].</p>
            <p class="note">It is important to understand the difference between precision and
              accuracy. Seven decimal places of a latitude degree corresponds to about one
              centimeter. Whatever the precision of the specified coordinates, the accuracy of
              positioning on the actual earth's surface using WGS84 will only approach about a metre
              horizontally and may have apparent errors of up to 100 metres vertically, because of
              assumptions about reference systems, tectonic plate movements and which definition of
              the earth's 'surface' is used.</p>

            <p>When known, the resolution and precision of spatial data should be specified in a way
              to allow consumers of the data to be aware of the resolution and level of details that

            <p>Entities and their properties can change over time and this change can be related to
              spatial properties, for example when a spatial thing moves from one location to
              another location, or when it becomes bigger or smaller. For some use cases you need to
              be able to explicitly refer to a particular version of information that describes a
                <a>SpatialThing</a>, or to infer which geometry is appropriate at a specific time,
              based on the versioning. To make this possible, the properties that are described for
              an entity should have references to the time and location that the information
              describing a <a>SpatialThing</a> was captured and should retain a version history.
              This allows you to reference the most recent data as well as previous versions and to
              also follow the changes of the properties. </p>

        <h3>Spatial Data Identifiers</h3>
        <p>In the geospatial community, the entities within datasets are usually information
          resources, representing areas on a map, which in turn represent real world things. These
          information resources are usually called 'features'. A feature is a representation of a
          real world thing and there could be, and often are, more than one feature representing the
          same real world thing. A feature often has, as a property, a geometry which describes the
          location of the feature.</p>
        <p>For example, a lighthouse standing somewhere on the coast is a real world thing. In some
          dataset, an information record about this lighthouse exists: a 'feature'. In current
          practice, this feature will often have properties that are about the real thing (e.g. the
          height of the lighthouse) and properties about the information record (e.g. when it was
          last modified). There could be several features, in different datasets, that refer to the
          same lighthouse; one dataset has its location and date it was built, another has data
          about its ownership or about shipwrecks near the same lighthouse.</p>
        <p>Mostly, people looking for information are interested in real world things, not in
          information resources. This means the real world things should get global identifiers so
          they can be found and referenced. The features and their map representations - geometries
          and topologies - should have global identifiers too so they can be referenced as well; and
          must have them if they are managed elsewhere.</p>
        <div class="issue" data-number="208">
          <p>Discussion on Features, information resources and real-world Things is unclear and

            <p>Good identifiers for data on the Web should be dereferenceable/resolvable, which
              makes it a good idea to use HTTP URIs as identifiers. There is no top down authority
              that you have to go to in order to create such identifiers for spatial objects. So
              just make them up yourself if you need them and they don't exist. <a href="#reuse-ids"

              general discussion on why persistent URIs should be used as identifiers for data
              entities. Using URIs means the data can be referenced using standard Web mechanisms;
              making them persistent means the links won't get broken. Note that ideally the URIs
              should resolve, however, they have value as globally scoped variables whether they

            <p>The URIs used by organizations such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a> and
                <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> to identify <a>SpatialThings</a> are
              commonly used across many different applications and datasets. In general, re-using
              well-known identifiers such as these is good practice because it makes it easy to
              recognise that data from different sources is has the same subject.</p>
            <p>Where possible, we want to avoid proliferation of identifiers for the same resource
              because this makes it difficult to link data. After all, these identifiers are like
              'Web-scale foreign keys', allowing information from different sources to be stitched
              together.</p>
            <p>Additionally, when these authoritative identifiers are resolved, a considerable
              amount of useful information about the <a>SpatialThing</a> is often provided that can
              be used to supplement that which is provided by your own application. Examples include
              place names in multiple languages and geographic boundaries.</p>
            <p class="note">Where you are not able to re-use an existing URI, you should link the
              your URI to those well-known URIs published by third parties, thus enabling your data

                >GeoNames</a> are examples of popular, community-driven resource collections.
              Another good source of resource collections is often found in public government data,
              such as national registers of addresses, buildings, and so on. Mapping and cadastral

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>There are many mechanisms to reconcile (i.e. find related, map or link) objects from
              different datasets. When two spatial datasets contain geometries, you can use spatial
              functions to find out which objects overlap, touch, etc. Based on this spatial
              correlation you might determine that two datasets are talking about the same places,
              but this is often not enough. For reasons of efficiency or simply for being able to
              use these spatial correlations in a context where spatial functions are not available,
              or explicit geometry is not available, it is a good idea to express these spatial
              relationships explicitly in your data. There is also danger in relying on spatial
              correlation alone, particularly if this is only handled in 2D and ignores any
              (explicit or undeclared) height and time component; you might conclude that two
              resources represent the same thing when in reality they represent, for example, a shop
              at ground level and living apartment above it.</p>

          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>If you want to link two spatial datasets, find out if they have corresponding
              geometries using spatial functions and then express these correspondences as explicit
              relationships.</p>
            <p>In this best practice we only give guidance on spatial reconciliation (e.g. two
              mentions of Paris are talking about the same place). We do not address thematic
              reconciliation.</p>
            <p>If the spatial datasets you want to reconcile are managed in a Geographic Information
              System (<a>GIS</a>) or a <a>spatial database</a>, you can use the GIS spatial
              functions to find related spatial things. If your spatial things are expressed as
              Linked Data, you can use [[GeoSPARQL]], which has a set of spatial query functions
              available. </p>
            <p>How to express discovered relationships is discussed in <a href="#semantic-rels">Best

            <div class="issue" data-number="102">
              <p>The scope of this Best Practice isn't quite correct. The intent is that it helps
                practitioners decide what to do when their data doesn't already have URIs, but at
                present it's more about reconciliation and linking with other resources (which
                overlaps with <a href="#link-to-related-resources">Best Practice 23: Link to related
                  resources</a>). The previous title ("<em>Working with data that lacks globally

                  Spatial reconciliation across datasets</em>") have been changed to reflect
                this.</p>
              <p>So far we have discussed the short comings of using names as identifiers (and the
                subsequent need for reconciliation). We also need to discuss assigning URIs based on
                local identifiers; for example, row numbers from tabular data or Feature identifiers
                from geo-databases.</p>

              that becomes smaller or bigger is generally still the same lake, but some links (e.g.

        <h3>Spatial Data Vocabularies</h3>
        <p>It is important to publish your spatial data with clear semantics. The primary use case
          for this is you have information about a collection of SpatialThings and you want to
          publish precise information about their attributes and how they are inter-related. Another
          use case is the publication on the Web of a dataset that has a spatial component in a form
          that search engines will understand. </p>
        <p>The attributes of a spatial thing can be described using existing vocabularies, where
          each term has a published definition. If you want to describe an aspect of the thing that
          matches that definition then it is good practice to use a term from an established widely
          used vocabulary. If you can't find a suitable existing vocabulary term, you should create
          your own, and publish a clear definition for the new term. If you need extra semantics not
          available in an existing vocabulary, you should create your own. </p>
        <p>How to publish your vocabulary, which describes the meaning of your data, is explained in
          [[LD-BP]]. We recommend that you link your own vocabulary to commonly used existing ones
          because this increases its usefulness. How to do this is out of scope for this document;
          however, we give some examples of mapping relations you can use from OWL, SKOS, RDFS. We
          also do the mapping between some commonly used spatial vocabularies. </p>
        <div class="issue" data-number="225">
          <p>We must avoid being overly focused on RDF.</p>
          <p>The [[LD-BP]] reference makes this section very RDF dependent. Is there a need /
            justification for this? Are we saying that RDF is the only recommended way to publish
            data and models on the Web? Web developers may not care about RDF vocabularies and maybe
            they prefer a Swagger document (just to pick an example)?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
          <p>The current list of RDF vocabularies / OWL ontologies for spatial data being considered
            by the SDW WG are provided below. Some of these will be used in examples. Full details,
            including mapping between vocabularies, pointers about inconsistencies in vocabularies

              <p>The format chosen to express geometry data should:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Support the dimensionality of the geometry;</li>
                <li>Be supported by the software tools used within data user community;</li>

              <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
              <p>Steps to follow: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Decide on the geometric data representations based on performance; often the
                  geometry data is a large proportion of the total size of a dataset.</li>
                <li>Determine the dimensionality of geometry data (0d 'point' to 3d 'volume').</li>
                <li>Determine which format(s) are supported by software tools that you anticipate
                  your user community to employ; where multiple formats are in required, consider
                  offering as many representations as you can - balancing the benefit of ease of use
                  against the cost of the additional storage or additional processing if converting
                  on-the-fly. See [[DWBP]] <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#Conneg">Best
                    Practice 22: Serving data and resources with different formats</a> for more
                  information.</li>
                <li>Choose the right format and decide when to use geometry literals. For geometry
                  literals, several solutions are available, like Well-Known Text (<a>WKT</a>)
                  representations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash">GeoHash</a> and
                  other geocoding representations. The alternative is to use structured geometry
                  objects as is possible, for example, in [[GeoSPARQL]].</li>
                <li>There are also several suitable binary data formats (e.g. <a
                    href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Google's protocol
                    buffers</a> for vector tiling); however, some binary formats do not
                  (effectively) work on the Web as there are no software tools for working with
                  those formats from within a typical Web application; to work with data in such
                  formats, you must first download the data and then work with it locally. </li>
                <li>There are widespread practices for representing geometric data as linked data,
                  such as using W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#">WGS84 Geo
                    Positioning vocabulary</a> (geo) <code>geo:lat</code> and <code>geo:long</code>
                  that are used extensively for describing <code>geo:Point</code> objects.</li>
                <li>Concrete geometry types are available, such as those defined in the OpenGIS
                  [[Simple-Features]] Specification, namely 0-dimensional Point and MultiPoint;
                  1-dimensional curve LineString and MultiLineString; 2-dimensional surface Polygon
                  and MultiPolygon; and the heterogeneous GeometryCollection. </li>

          <h4>Publishing data with clear semantics</h4>
          <p>In most cases, the effective use of information resources requires understanding
            thematic concepts in addition to the spatial ones; "spatial" is just a facet of the
            broader information space. For example, when the <a
              href="http://www.brandweer.nl/amsterdam-amstelland">Dutch Fire Service</a> responded
            to an incident at a day care center, they needed to evacuate the children. In this case,
            the <em>2nd</em> closest alternative day care center was preferred because it was
            operated by the same organization as the one that was subject of the incident, and they
            knew who all the children were.</p>
          <p>This best practice document provides mechanisms for determining how places and
            locations are related - but determining the compatibility or validity of thematic data
            elements is beyond our scope; we're not attempting to solve the problem of different
            views on the same/similar resources.</p>

              <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
              <p>There are various vocabularies that provide common information (semantics) about

                best practice provides a method for selecting the right vocabulary (or vocabularies)
                for your intended goal. The semantic description of entities and their properties
                should use the existing common vocabularies in their descriptions to increase the
                interoperability with other descriptions that may refer to the same vocabularies.
                The steps required to choose the best vocabularies are: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Go through a selection process to decide on the existing and relevant
                  vocabularies that can be used to describe the spatial things and their properties. </li>
                <li>Maintain links to the vocabularies in the schema definitions and provide
                  linked-data descriptions.</li>
                <li>Define location and spatial references using the common vocabulary concepts
                  whenever applicable instead of defining your own location instance. </li>
                <li>Provide thematic semantics and general descriptions of spatial things and their
                  properties as linked data. They should have URIs that return human and machine
                  readable definitions when resolved. For more information refer to [[DWBP]] <a

            <p class="practicedesc">Spatial relationships between Things should be specified in
              forms of geographical, topological and hierarchical links.</p>
            <section class="axioms">
              <p class="subhead">Why</p>
              <p>It is often more efficient to rely on relationships asserted between SpatialThings
                rather than rely on solutions such as analysis of geometries to find out that two
                Things are, for example, at the same place, near each other, or one is inside the
                other. Describing the spatial relationships between SpatialThings can be based on
                relationships such as topological, geographical and hierarchical (e.g. partOf)
                links.</p>
              <p>Relating SpatialThings to other spatial data enables, for example, digital personal
                assistants (e.g. Siri, Cortana) to make helpful suggestions or infer useful
                information such as "address" and "description" attributes added to extent data
                model of GeoLocation API. See also <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/emma/">W3C EMMA
                  2.0</a>; devices provide location and time-stamp data, and this helps us, for
                example:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Determining whether 'this' device interaction was 'within' a car, rather than
                  the device being carried by a pedestrian, may result in different outcomes or
                  suggestions.</li>
                <li>Determining whether an event for a traveler took place after the journey started
                  and before it ended … we can infer the event was on-route.</li>
                <li>The term <em>near</em> is contextual - a straight line distance calculated by
                  simple geometric analysis does not take into account the mode and speed of travel
                  or available pathways.</li>
                <li>Capturing social information; "I'm on my way to work" rather than "I'm here" …
                  where work is a SpatialThing with indistinct boundaries.</li>

              <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
              <p>This requirement will allow expressing explicit spatial relationships between
                Things in the form of geographical, topological and hierarchical links that will not
                need post geometric processing and inferring to find the spatial links.</p>

              <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
              <p>How to use spatial functions to find out if spatial things have corresponding
                geometries is described in <a href="#lacking-ids">Best Practice 3: Working with data
                  that lacks globally unique identifiers for entity-level resources</a>. This best
                practice describes how to express these discovered relationships between resources
                about physical and conceptual spatial things.</p>
              <p>The asserted spatial semantics can include relationship such as nearby, contains,
                etc. This best practice requires specifying geometric, topological and social
                spatial relationships. It is also important to determine which relationships are
                appropriate for a given case (This is beyond the scope of this BP). This best
                practice requires:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The geographical, topological and social hierarchy (part of) should be described
                  with clear semantics and registered with IANA <a

                    relations</a>.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical relationships (i.e. part of, for example between administrative
                  regions, have a specific need for defining <em>Mutually Exclusive Collectively
                    Exhaustive</em> (MECE) set.</li>
                <li>Topological relationships that are described for an entity should have
                  references to concepts such as over, under etc.</li>
                <li>Spatial relationships can use concepts such as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_connection_calculus">Region
                    Connection Calculus</a> (RCC8) that contains, overlaps, touches, intersects,
                  adjacent to, or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM#Spatial_predicates"
                    >spatial predicates</a>" or also other similar concepts from <a

              </ul>
              <p>Social relationships can be defined based on perception; e.g. "samePlaceAs",
                nearby, south of. These relationships can also be defined based on temporal concepts
                such as: after, around, etc. In current practice, there is no such property as
                  <code>samePlaceAs</code> to express the social notion of <em>place</em>; enabling
                communities to unambiguously indicate that they are referring to the same place but
                without getting hung up on the semantic complexities inherent in the use of
                  <code>owl:sameAs</code> or similar.</p>

            href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#dataAccess">section 9.11 Data Access</a>?</p>
        <p><a>SDIs</a> have long been used to provide access to spatial data via web services;
          typically using open standard specifications from the <a
            href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC). With the
          exception of the <a>Web Map Service</a>, these OGC Web service specifications have not
          seen widespread adoption beyond the geospatial expert community. In parallel, we have seen
          widespread emergence of Web applications that use spatial data - albeit focusing largely
          on point-based data.</p>
        <p>This section seeks to capture the best practices that have emerged from the wider Web
          community for accessing spatial data via the Web. While [[DWBP]] provides best practices
          discussing access to data using Web infrastructure (see [[DWBP]] <a
            href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#dataAccess">section 9.11 Data Access</a>), this
          section provides additional insight for publishers of spatial data. In particular, we look
          at how <em>Application Program Interfaces</em> (API) may be used to make it easy to work
          with spatial data.</p>
        <p class="note">The term API as used here refers to the combination of the <i>set of
            operations</i> provided and the <i>data content</i> exposed by a particular Web service
          end-point.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Making data available on the Web requires data publishers to provide some form of
              access to the data. There are numerous mechanisms available, each providing varying
              levels of utility and incurring differing levels of effort and cost to implement and
              maintain. Publishers of spatial data should make their data available on the Web using
              affordable mechanisms in order to ensure long-term, sustainable access to their
              data.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Data is published on the Web in a mechanism that the data publisher can afford to

          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>When determining the mechanism to be used provide Web access to data, publishers need
              to assess utility against cost. In order of increasing usefulness and cost:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Bulk-download or streaming of the entire dataset (see [[DWBP]] <a
                  href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#BulkAccess">Best Practice 20: Provide bulk
                  download</a>)</li>
              <li>Generalized query API (such as <a>WFS</a> or SPARQL [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]])</li>
              <li>Bespoke API designed to support a particular application (see <a
                  href="#convenience-apis">Best Practice 28: Expose entity-level data through
                  'convenience APIs'</a>)</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note">[[DWBP]] indicates that when data that is logically organized as one
              container and is distributed across many URLs, accessing the data in bulk is useful.
              As a minimum, it should be possible for users to download data on the Web as a single
              resource; e.g. through bulk file formats.</p>
            <p class="note">A data publisher need not incur all the costs alone. Given motivation,
              third parties (such as the open data community or commercial providers) may provide
              value-added services that build on simple bulk-download or generalized query
              interfaces. While establishing such arrangements is beyond the scope of this document,
              it is important to note that the data publisher should consider the end-to-end data
              publication chain. For example, one may need to consider including conditions in the
              usage license about the timeliness of frequently changing data.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>When access to spatial data is provided by bulk download or through a generalized
              query service, users need to understand how the data is structured in order to work
              effectively with that data. Given that spatial data may be arbitrarily complex, this
              burdens the data user with significant effort before they can even perform simple
              queries. <strong>Convenience APIs</strong> are tailored to meet a specific goal;
              enabling a user to engage with arbitrarily complex data structures using (a set of)
              simple queries. As stated in [[DWBP]], an API offers the greatest flexibility and
              processability for consumers of data; for example, enabling real-time data usage,
              filtering on request, and the ability to work with the data at an atomic level. If
              your dataset is large, frequently updated, or highly complex, a convenience API is
              likely to be helpful.</p>

              API</a>.</p>
            <p>The API should be targeted to deliver a coherent set of functions that are design to
              meet the needs of common tasks. Work with your developer community to determine the
              tasks that they want to do with the data or use your experience to infer those tasks.
              Design your API to help developers achieve those tasks. API operations may be one
              of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>query and response - for requesting data</li>
              <li>publish and subscribe - for disseminating real-time or event-based data</li>
              <li>transaction - for storing, modifying, processing or analysing data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Include light-weight queries and/or operations in the API that help users start
              working with your data quickly. The complexity of the data should be hidden from
              inexperienced users.</p>
            <p>The API should offer <em>both</em> machine readable data and human readable HTML that
              includes the structured metadata required by search engines seeking to index content
              (see <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines">Best Practice 25: Make your entity-level
                data indexable by search engines</a> for more details).</p>
            <p>When designing the API, each operation or query should be focused on achieving a
              single outcome; this should ensure that the API remains light-weight. Groups of API
              operations may be chained together (like unix pipes) in order to complete complex
              tasks.</p>
            <p>When designing APIs, data publishers must be aware of the constraints of operating in
              a Web environment. Providing access to large datasets, such as <a>coverages</a>, is a
              particular challenge. The API should provide mechanisms to request subsets of the
              dataset that are a convenient size for client applications to manage.</p>
            <p>APIs will often evolve as more data is added or usage changes; queries or operations
              may be changed or new ones added. APIs should be versioned in order to insulate
              downstream client applications from these changes.</p>
            <p class="note">Regarding API design, also see [[DWBP]] <a

                Standardized Interfaces</a>.</p>
            <p>In the geospatial domain there are a lot of <a>WFS</a> services providing data. A
              RESTful API as a wrapper or a shim layer could be created around WFS services. GML
              content from the WFS service could be provided in this way as linked data or another
              Web friendly format. This approach is similar to the use of Z39.50 in the library
              community; that protocol is still used but 'modern' Web sites and web services are
              wrapped around it. Adding URIs in (GML) data exposed by a WFS is pretty
              straightforward, but making the data 'webby' is harder. There are examples of this
              approach of creating a convenience API on top of WFS, but rather than adapting the WFS
              (GML) output, it may be more effective to provide an alternative 'Linked Data
              friendly' access path to the data source; creating a new, complementary service
              endpoint e.g. expose the underpinning postGIS database via SPARQL endpoint (using
              something like <a href="http://www.melodiesproject.eu/content/ontop-spatial"
                >ontop-spatial</a>) and Linked Data API.</p>

                your API</a>.</p>
            <p>API documentation should describe the data(set) it exposes; the APIs operations and
              parameters; what kind of format / payload the API offers; and API versioning.</p>
            <p>As a minimum, you should provide a human readable description of your APIs so that
              developers can read about how the API works. We recommend providing machine readable
              API documentation that can be used by software development tools to help developers
              build API client software. API documentation should be crawlable via search
              engines.</p>
            <p>The API documentation should be generated from the API code so that the documentation
              can be easily kept upto date.</p>
            <p>Where a parameter domain is bound to a set of values (e.g. value range, spatial or
              temporal extent, controlled vocabulary etc.), the API documentation or the API itself
              should indicate the set of values that may be used in order to help users request data
              that is <em>actually</em> available.</p>
            <p>The API documentation should be discoverable from the API itself.</p>

                  request 'getCapabilities', and then returns an XML document giving information
                  about the service such as the Coordinate Reference system used, the data structure

                  providing a set of values, terms or entities for each API parameter (ref. CSIRO's

                  URLs. A 'short-form' of the identifier may be required for usage in the API; this
                  may be defined as a SKOS notation.</li>

                  the property <code>qb:codeList</code>). The URI Set (the set of all SpatialThings
                  mentioned in the Data Cube) provides a 'controlled vocabulary' of locations for
                  which 'observations' (data points) in the Data Cube are available (e.g. air

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Two possible approaches are described below:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Create named subsets. <ul>
                  <li>Determine how users may seek to access the dataset, determining subsets of the
                    larger dataset that are appropriate for the intended application. A data
                    provider may consider a general approach to improve accessibility of a dataset,
                    while a data user might want to publish details of a workflow for others to
                    reuse referencing only the relevant parts of the large dataset.</li>
                  <li>Given the anticipated access pattern, create new resources and mint a new
                    identifier for each subset.</li>
                  <li>Provide metadata to indicate how a given subset resource is related to the
                    original large dataset, with reference to an identified <em>Mutually Exclusive
                      Collectively Exhaustive</em> (MECE) set where appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Map a URI pattern to an existing data-access API. <p class="note">A Web service
                  URL in general does not provide a good URI for a resource as it is unlikely to be
                  persistent. A Web service URL is often technology and implementation dependent and
                  both are very likely to change with time. For example, consider oft used
                  parameters such as <code>?version=</code>. Good practice is to use URIs that will
                  resolve as long as the resource is relevant and may be referenced by others,
                  therefore identifiers for subsets should be <em>protocol independent</em>.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Identify the service end-point that provides access to the larger
                    dataset.</li>
                  <li>Determine which parameters offered by the service end-point are required to
                    construct a meaningful subset.</li>
                  <li>Map these parameters into a URI pattern and configure an HTTP server to apply
                    the necessary URL-rewrite.</li>

        <h3>Linking Spatial Data</h3>
        <p>In the wider Web, it is links that enable the discovery of web pages: from user-agents
          following a hyperlink to find related information to search engines using links to
          prioritise and refine search results. This section is concerned with the creation and use
          of those links to support discovery of the <a>SpatialThings</a> described in spatial
          datasets.</p>
        <p>For data to be <em>on the web</em> the resources it describes need to be connected, or
            <em>linked</em>, to other resources. The <em>connectedness</em> of data is one of the
          fundamentals of the Linked Data approach that these best practices build upon. The <a
            href="http://5stardata.info">5-star rating for Linked Open Data</a> asserts that to
          achieve the fifth star you must "link your data to other data to provide context". The
          benefits for consumers and publishers of linking to other data are <a
            href="http://5stardata.info/en/#addendum5">listed</a> as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can discover more (related) data while consuming the data.</li>
          <li>You can directly learn about the data schema.</li>
          <li>You make your data discoverable.</li>
          <li>You increase the value of your data.</li>
          <li>Your own organization will gain the same benefits from the links as the [other]
            consumers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just like any type of data, spatial data benefits massively from linking when publishing
          on the web.</p>
        <p class="note">The widespread use of links within data is regarded as one of the most
          significant departures from contemporary practices used within SDIs.</p>
        <p>Crucially, the use of links is predicated on the ability to identify the origin and
          target, or <em>beginning</em> and <em>end</em>, of the link. <a
            href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 1: Use globally unique identifiers for
            entity-level resources</a> is a prerequisite.</p>
        <p>This section extends [[DWBP]] by providing best practices that are concerned with
            <em>creating</em> links between the resources described inside datasets. Best practices
          detailing the use of links to support discovery are provided in <a href="#bp-discovery"

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Exposing entity-level links to web applications, user-agents and web crawlers allows
              the relationships between resources to be found without the data user needing to
              download the entire dataset for local analysis. Entity-level links provide explicit
              description of the relationships between resources and enable users to find related
              data and determine whether the related data is worth accessing. Entity-level links can
              be used to combine information from different sources; for example, to determine
              correlations in statistical data relating to the same location.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Links enable a network of related resources to be connected together. For those

              resources need to have durable identifiers. Typically, it is the <a>SpatialThings</a>

                1: Use globally unique identifiers for entity-level resources</a>) whereas the

              <p>This best practice is concerned with the connections <em>between</em>
                <a>SpatialThings</a>. When describing an individual <a>SpatialThing</a> itself, it
                is often desirable to decompose the information into several uniquely identified
                objects. For example, the geometry of an administrative area may be managed as a
                separate resource due to the large number of geometric points required to describe
                the boundary.</p>
              <p>Also note that in many cases, different identifiers are used to describe the

            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>In Linked Data, commonly used resources behave like hubs in the network of
              interlinked resources. By linking your spatial resources to those in common usage it
              will be easier to discover your resources. For example, a data user interested in air
              quality data about the place they live might begin by searching for that place in
              popular data repositories such as <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a>, <a
                href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> or <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/"
                >DBpedia</a>. Once the user finds the resource that describes the correct place,
              they can search for data that refers to the identified resource that, in this case,
              relates to air quality.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, by referring to resources in common usage, it becomes even easier to
              find those resources as search engines will prioritize resources that are linked to
              more often.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Relationships between resources with with spatial extent (i.e. size, shape, or
              position; <a>SpatialThings</a>) can often be inferred from their spatial properties.
              For example, two resources might occur at the same location suggesting that they may
              be the same resource, or one resource might exist entirely within the bounds of
              another resource suggesting some kind of hierarchical containment relationship.
              However, reconciliation of such resources is complex: it requires some degree of
              understanding about the semantics of the two, potentially related, resources in order
              to determine how they are related, if at all.</p>
            <p>Rather than expecting that data consumers will have sufficient context to relate
              resources, it is better for data publishers to assert the relationships that they know
              about. Not only does this provide data users with clear information about how
              resources are related, it removes the need for complex spatial processing (e.g. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_connection_calculus">region connection
                calculus</a>) to determine potential relationships between resources with spatial
              extent because those relations are already made explicit.</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>Where possible, existing identifiers should be reused when referring to resources
                (see <a href="http://w3c.github.io/sdw/bp/#reuse-ids">Best Practice 2: Reuse
                  existing (authoritative) identifiers when available</a>). However, the use of
                multiple identifiers for the same resource is commonplace, for example, where data
                publishers from different jurisdictions refer to the same <a>SpatialThing</a>. In
                this special case, properties such as <code>owl:sameAs</code> can be used to declare
                that multiple identifiers refer to the same resource. It is often the case that data
                published from different sources about the same physical or conceptual resource may
                provide different view points.</p>

            <p>A data user can browse between (information about) related resources using the
              explicitly defined links to discover more information.</p>
            <p>In the special case that the property <code>owl:sameAs</code> is used to relate
              identifiers, information whose subject is one of the respective identifiers can be
              combined.</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>The property <code>owl:sameAs</code> is often misused with the intent to say that
                two resources are <em>similar</em>. The definition of <code>owl:sameAs</code>
                indicates that the relationship is used to relate two URIs that identify the
                  <em>same</em> resource.</p>
              <p>Additionally, a data user should always exercise some discretion when working with
                data from different sources; for example, to determine whether the data is timely,
                accurate or trustworthy. Further discussion on this issue is beyond the scope of

      <h2>Authoritative sources of geographic identifiers</h2>
      <p>As per <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html"
          >http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html</a> item 4, it's useful for people to link
        their data to other related data. In this context we're most frequently talking about either
        Spatial Things and/or their geometry.</p>
      <p> There are many useful sets of identifiers for spatial things and which ones are most
        useful will depend on context. This involves discovering relevant URIs that you might want
        to connect to.</p>
      <p>Relevant URIs for spatial things can be found in many places. This list gives the first
        places you should check:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a></li>
        <li>National open spatial datasets such as are made available by for example the UK and
          Dutch governments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finding out which national open spatial datasets are available, and how they can be
        accessed, currently requires prior knowledge in most cases because these datasets are often
        not easily discoverable. Look for national dataportals / geoportals such as <a
          href="http://nationaalgeoregister.nl">Nationaal Georegister</a> (Dutch national register
        of geospatial datasets) or <a href="https://data.overheid.nl">Dataportaal van de Nederlandse
          overheid</a> (Dutch national governmental data portal). </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>As an example, let's take Edinburgh. In some recent work with the Scottish Government, we
          have an identifier for the City of Edinburgh Council Area - i.e. the geographical area
          that Edinburgh City Council is responsible for:</p>
        <code>http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</code>
        <p>(note that this URI doesn't resolve yet but it will in the next couple of months once the
          system goes properly live)</p>
        <p>The UK government provides an identifier for Edinburgh and/or information about it that
          we might want to link to:</p>
        <p><a href="http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036"
            >http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</a></p>
        <p>The Scottish identifier is directly based on this one, but the Scottish Government wanted
          the ability to create something dereferenceable, potentially with additional or different
          info to the data.gov.uk one. These two are owl:sameAs.</p>
        <p><a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh"></a></p>
        <p>DBpedia also includes a resource about Edinburgh. Relationship: "more or less the same
          as" but probably not the strict semantics of owl:sameAs.</p>
        <p><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81482"
            >http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81482</a></p>
        <p>This Edinburgh resource is found by querying the OS gazetteer search service for
          'Edinburgh' then checking the labels of the results that came up. OS give it a type of
          'NamedPlace' and give it some coordinates.</p>
        <p><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81483"
            >http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81483</a></p>
        <p>This Edinburgh airport resource was also found by the same OS gazetteer search service
          for 'Edinburgh'. This is clearly not the same as the original spatial thing, but you might
          want to say something like 'within' or 'hasAirport'.</p>
        <p><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505"
            >http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505</a></p>
        <p>This resource is in the OS 'Boundary Line' service that contains administrative and
          statistical geography areas in the UK. It's probably safe to say the original identifier
          is owl:sameAs this one.</p>
        <p><a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2650225/">http://sws.geonames.org/2650225/</a></p>
        <p>This is the Geonames resource for Edinburgh found using the search service:
            <code>http://api.geonames.org/search?name=Edinburgh&amp;type=rdf&amp;username=demo</code>
          Once you have found a place in GeoNames, there are other useful services to find things
          that are nearby. </p>

      <p><dfn data-lt="link|links">Link</dfn>: A a typed connection between two resources that are identified by Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [[RFC3987]], and is comprised of: (i) a context IRI, (ii) a link relation type, (iii) a target IRI, and (iv) optionally, target attributes. Note that in the common case, the IRI will also be a URI [[RFC3986]], because many protocols (such as HTTP) do not support dereferencing IRIs. <span style="background-color:yellow">[[RFC5988]]</span></p>
      <p><dfn>Linked data</dfn>: The term ‘Linked Data’ refers to an approach to publishing data that puts linking at the heart of the notion of data, and uses the linking technologies provided by the Web to enable the weaving of a global distributed database. <span style="background-color:yellow">[[LDP-PRIMER]]</span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Open-world assumption|open world assumption|OWA">Open-world assumption (OWA)</dfn>: In a formal system of logic used for knowledge representation, the open-world assumption asserts that the truth value of a statement may be true irrespective of whether or not it is known to be true. This assumption codifies the informal notion that in general no single agent or observer has complete knowledge. In essence, from the absence of a statement alone, a deductive reasoner cannot (and must not) infer that the statement is false. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">wikipedia</a></span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Resource description framework|RDF">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</dfn>: A directed, labeled graph data model for representing information in the Web. It may be serialised in a number of data formats such as N-Triples [[N-TRIPLES]], XML [[RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]], Terse Triple Language (“turtle” or TTL) [[TURTLE]] and JSON-LD [[JSON-LD]].</p>
      <p><dfn>Semantic web</dfn>: The term “Semantic Web” refers to World Wide Web Consortium's vision of the Web of <a>linked data</a>. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data.</p>
      <p><dfn>SPARQL</dfn>: A query language for <a>RDF</a>; it can be used to express queries across diverse data sources. <span style="background-color:yellow">[[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]]</span></p>
      <p><dfn>Spatial data</dfn>: Data describing anything with spatial extent; i.e. size, shape or position. In addition to describing things that are positioned relative to the Earth (also see geospatial data), spatial data may also describe things using other coordinate systems that are not related to position on the Earth, such as the size, shape and positions of cellular and sub-cellular features described using the 2D or 3D cartesian coordinate system of a specific tissue sample.</p>
      <p><dfn>Spatial database</dfn>: A spatial database, or geodatabase, is a database that is optimized to store and query data that represents objects defined in a geometric space. Most spatial databases allow representation of simple geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons and provide functions to determine spatial relationships (overlaps, touches etc).</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="SDI|SDIs|Spatial Data Infrastructure|Spatial Data Infrastructures">SDI</dfn>: An ecosystem of geographic data, metadata, tools, applications, policies and users that are necessary to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain, and preserve spatial data. Due to its nature (size, cost, number of interactors) an SDI is often government-related.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Spatial Thing|Spatial Things|SpatialThing|SpatialThings">Spatial thing</dfn>: Anything with spatial extent, i.e. size, shape, or position. e.g. people, places, bowling balls, as well as abstract areas like cubes. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos">[W3C-BASIC-GEO]</a></span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Temporal Thing|TemporalThing|TemporalThings">Temporal thing</dfn>: Anything with temporal extent, i.e. duration. e.g. the taking of a photograph, a scheduled meeting, a GPS time-stamped trackpoint <span style="background-color:yellow"><a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos">[W3C-BASIC-GEO]</a></span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="triple-store|triple store|triple stores|quad-store|quadstore">Triple-store (or quadstore)</dfn>: A triple-store or <a>RDF</a> store is a purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of RDF subject-predicate-object “triples” through semantic queries. Many implementations are actually “quad-stores” as they also hold the name of the graph within which a triple is stored.</p>
      <p><dfn>Universe of discourse</dfn>: View of the real or hypothetical world that includes everything of interest. <span style="background-color:yellow">[ISO-19101] §4.29</span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="WCS|Web Coverage Service">Web Coverage Service (WCS)</dfn>: A service offering multi-dimensional coverage data for access over the Internet. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs">[OGC-WCS]</a></span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="WFS|Web Feature Service">Web Feature Service (WFS)</dfn>: A standardized HTTP interface allowing requests for geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs">[OGC-WFS]</a></span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="WMS|Web Map Service">Web Map Service (WMS)</dfn>: A standardized HTTP interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed geospatial databases. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms">[OGC-WMS]</a></span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="well known text|well-known-text|wkt">Well Known Text (WKT)</dfn>: A text markup language for representing vector geometry objects on a map, spatial reference systems of spatial objects and transformations between spatial reference systems. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">wikipedia</a></span>)</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="WPS|Web Processing Service">Web Processing Service (WPS)</dfn>: An interface standard which provides rules for standardizing inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for invoking geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, as a Web service. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps">[OGC-WPS]</a></span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Extensible Markup Language|XML">Extensible Markup Language (XML)</dfn>: A simple, very flexible text-based markup language derived from SGML (ISO 8879). It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. <span style="background-color:yellow">[[XML11]]</span></p>
