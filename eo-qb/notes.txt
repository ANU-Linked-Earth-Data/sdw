0. validate the .ttl 

1. Dont use equivalentclass here. why not just "a"?

:pixelsPerDegree rdf:type rdfs:Datatype ;
    owl:equivalentClass xsd:double .

2. crs 
qb4st:crs <http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326> . 
BP uses http://epsg.io/4326   -- is that better? if so, should BP be changed?

3. Have not checked the qb4st


4. :resolution "2.7"^^:pixelsPerDegree ;
I don't think that is valid -- the bit after the ^^ has to be an xsd datatype, surely?

5. DELETED 

6. rdfs:range [owl:unionOf(xsd:anyURI xsd:integer)] ; - not sure I am happy with this. As rdfs tools (and so probably also datacube tools) might not figure it? Cannot think of a solution other than removing hte range entirely.

7. Example 4 " :dataValue  ;" is this well-formed ttl?

8. 'However, it is reasonable to attach such metadata to aggregated <i>tiles</i>of pixels.
           Thus the RDF data model can be used, as long as RDF Data Cube observations are whole tiles rather than individual pixels [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TilngSupport">Support for tiling</a>]."  this seems out of place -- case for tiling. perhaps cut "thus...[to end]". <partly did this>

9. "QB4ST [qb4st] does not currently have a term for that, but it may in the future." -check

10. Consider removing "This is also the appropriate place to think about the experience of Web crawlers on the publisher's Web page [Crawlability, Machine to machine]." as the relevant BP says to put it on an HTML page and we are not doing that at all.  https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#indexable-by-search-engines

11. BP Encoding spatial data https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#semantic-thing needs an example for "Balancing quality and cost. This could be it?

12. "qb4st:crs "rHEALPix WGS84 Ellipsoid" " is that a crs?

13. BP approach 3 could point to EO-QB. 

14. example 8 uses unusual sparql layout (";" at begining of line) -- I like it a lot, but it is non-customary and might confuse?

15. Example 8 led:etmBand      led:latMin led:longMax led:value are not in ANU-LED-example.ttl. They need to be (and they nee to be explained). LEd uses "bounds" instead.  Also the example seems to be outofdate wrt QB4st in the ontology?  Also it uses led:Pixel -- shouldn't it be a GridSquare (tile?). 

16. SSN might well change its name and prefix shortly.

17. Several changes to ssn in the area of example 9. Platform, observes, onPlatform, maybe hasMeasurementCapability. Should add ssn:accuracy.

18 add a table of omntologies used (see section ).

19. Example 10 does this again: ":s1   .... :dataValue  ;" . what about this?  ":s1 :datavalue [ a xsd:integer] ; "  


20. example 10 :exampleDataset ... prov:wasDerivedFrom :AGDC .
I don't think the wasderivedfrom is appropriate here. wasderivedfrom is used if you don't want to talk about the corresponding activitity, but you do -- it " prov:wasGeneratedBy :ANU-led-resampling " and you can get to the Entity that as used for that from there -- ":ANU-led-resampling  ... prov:used :AGDC ."



21. example 10 ":AGDC a prov:Collection ;
    prov:wasAssociatedWith :GeoscienceAustralia ;
    prov:hadMember :example-tile . " this should be prov wasAttributedTo, not prov:wasAssociatedWith , becuase it relates Entity to Agent.

22. Example 13: check ssn:Property for change

23. BP doc section 6 'Coverages: describing properties that vary with location (and time)" should reference EO-QB and coverage-JSON.



24. Example 14. timedomain is a time:Interval that appears to be very short (begins and ends at "2001-10-26T21:32:52) . However, it is normal for satellite imagery to instead be given a (real) time period due to the  time taken to travel over the surface.  I like that the particular :grid Square has only a time instant, but surely the timedomain could be longer?

25 (no for eo-qb) BP doc should crossrefernce req https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#CoverageTemporalExtent  with 
http://w3c.github.io/sdw/bp/#desc-changing-properties

26. Needs a table of ontolgies used -- see section 7.
