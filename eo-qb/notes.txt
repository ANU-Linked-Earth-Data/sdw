9. "QB4ST [qb4st] does not currently have a term for that, but it may in the future."

15. Example 8 led:etmBand      led:latMin led:longMax led:value are not in ANU-LED-example.ttl. They need to be (and they nee to be explained). LEd uses "bounds" instead.  Also the example seems to be outofdate wrt QB4st in the ontology?  Also it uses led:Pixel -- shouldn't it be a GridSquare (tile?). 

16. SSN might well change its name and prefix shortly.

17. Several changes to ssn in the area of example 9. Platform, observes, onPlatform, maybe hasMeasurementCapability. Should add ssn:accuracy.

22. Example 13: check ssn:Property for change

24. Example 14. timedomain is a time:Interval that appears to be very short (begins and ends at "2001-10-26T21:32:52) . However, it is normal for satellite imagery to instead be given a (real) time period due to the  time taken to travel over the surface.  I like that the particular :grid Square has only a time instant, but surely the timedomain could be longer?
