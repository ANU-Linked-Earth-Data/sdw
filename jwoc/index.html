      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Spatial information is of high value and importance in almost all data on the Web. As well as obvious use cases such as cartography and Earth sciences, events happen at a defined location, news stories affect a defined region, and, in a biomedical research lab, pathogens affect defined regions of tissue. Technologies like augmented reality and the Internet and Web of Things all depend on location. Members of OGC and W3C have defined sets of technologies that underpin (geo)spatial information systems and the Web respectively but both stand to benefit from direct cooperation, increasing the value of data and the power of applications that consume it.</p>
<p>The broad scope of the Spatial Data <abbr title="Interest Group">IG</abbr> is to realize the W3C side of the Joint W3C/OGC Organizing Committee (JWOC), which exists to facilitate direct cooperation. The JWOC will publish joint work where appropriate and recommend the creation of formal standards-defining working groups where necessary in one or both standards development organizations.</p>

        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The Spatial Data Interest Group is <em>only</em> concerned with areas where it is in the interests of both OGC and W3C to collaborate.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>Although the Spatial Data Interest Group will not create any Recommendations, it is expected to be able to show real world implementation experience for its outputs. It is expected to complete its deliverables within the 2 year time scale envisaged in this charter.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>

        <p>More detailed milestones and updated publication schedules are available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/[groupname]/PubStatus">group publication status page</a>.</p>
        <p>The Interest Group will deliver the following joint W3C/OGC specifications:</p>

          <dd>
          <p>CoverageJSON was originally developed by the University of Reading under the MELODIES project and provides a method of representing coverage data, such as Earth observation data, in JSON. The IG will work to develop this further. The publication cited above merely <em>describes</em> Coverage JSON, it does not define it.</p>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Spatial Data Interest Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a> where appropriate.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>


 <h3 id="ogc">Relationship with OGC</h3>
<p>In collaboration with the W3C, the Open Geosptial Consortium, OGC, will create
a sub-working group of the Geosemantics Domain Working Group
subject to its usual practice and rules of membership. This will be a
RAND-Royalty Free Standards Working Group according to section 3.2.2 of OGC's
2008 Intellectual Property Rights Policy
(<a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=32268">PDF</a>)
to ensure compatibility with W3C's
<a href="#patentpolicy">Patent Policy</a>.
Formally, each group will have its own charter and operate under the respective
organization's rules of membership, <em>however</em>, the
'two groups' will work together very closely as the Joint W3C/OGC Organization Committee, JWOC, and create a set of common outputs
as set out <a href="#deliverables">above</a> that will be jointly branded.</p>
<p>As is now common practice, the W3C group will work in public, i.e. it will
use a publicly visible mailing list and wiki, and the editor's drafts of its
documents will be publicly visible (e.g. on GitHub). To enable write access to
these facilities, unless there are specific reasons to the contrary,
members of the OGC WG who do not represent W3C member organizations will be
granted <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2014/08-invited-expert.html">Invited Expert</a>
status, with all obligations and privileges, in the SDWWG but without access to member-only resources.</p>
<p>It is expected that the WG's chairs and editors will represent organizations that are members of both standards bodies.</p>

      <section class="participation">
        <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
        <p>To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from both the Web and geospatial communities (inasmuch as they differ), as well as active Editors for each specification. The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Interest Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.</p>
        <p>The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.</p>
        <p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.</p>
      </section>



      <section id="communication">
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p id="public">Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.</p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">@@@ Spatial Data Interest Group home page.@@@</a></p>
        <p>Spatyial Data Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work  <i class="todo">pick one, or both, as appropriate:</i> on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-[email-list]@w3.org">public-<i class="todo">[email-list]</i>@w3.org</a> (<a class="todo" href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-[email-list]/">archive</a>)
          <i class="todo">or</i> on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.</p>
        <p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.</p>
        <p>All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.</p>
        <p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.</p>

      <p><i class="todo">[Keep 'Patent Policy' for a Working Group, 'Patent Disclosures' for an Interest Group]</i></p>

        <h2>Patent Policy</h2>
        <p>This Working Group operates under the <a href="http://w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/">W3C Patent Policy</a> (5 February 2004 Version). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Recommendations that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent Policy Implementation</a>.</p>

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a shape="rect" href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
