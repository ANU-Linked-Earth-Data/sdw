# SOSA-Core Classes

sosa-core:Sensor
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "Device, agent (including humans), or software (simulation) involved in, or implementing, a (sensing) Procedure. Sensors responds to a stimulus, e.g., a change in the environment, and generates a Result. Sensors can be mounted on platforms, e.g., a modern smart phone hosts multiple sensors."@en ;
  rdfs:label "Sensor"@en ;
.
sosa-core:Observation
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "An Observation carries out an (observation) Procedure to estimate or calculate a value of a Property of a FeatureOfInterest. Links to a Platform or Sensor to describe what made the Observation and how; links to an ObservableProperty to describe what the result is an estimate of, and to a FeatureOfInterest to detail what that property was associated with; the Result is the output."@en ;
  rdfs:label "Observation"@en ;
.
sosa-core:ObservableProperty
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "An observable Quality of a thing; typically a FeatureOfInterest."@en ;
  rdfs:label "Observable Property"@en ;
.
sosa-core:Sample
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "Feature on which observations may be made, which is intended to be representative of a FeatureOfInterest that is not fully accessible."@en ;
  rdfs:comment """Samples are artifacts of an observational strategy, and have no significant function outside of their role in the observation process. The physical characteristics of the features themselves are of little interest, except perhaps to the manager of a sampling campaign.

EXAMPLE A “station” is essentially an identifiable locality where a sensor system or procedure may be deployed and an observation made. In the context of the observation model, it connotes the “world in the vicinity of the station”, so the observed properties relate to the physical medium at the station, and not to any physical artifact such as a mooring, buoy, benchmark, monument, well, etc.

NOTE A transient sample, such as a ships-track or flight-line, might be identified and described, but is unlikely to be revisited exactly.

A sample is intended to sample some feature-of-interest in an application domain, so there is an expectation of at least one sampledFeature property. However, in some cases the identity, and even the exact type, of the sampled feature may not be known when observations are made using the sampling features."""@en ;
  rdfs:label "Sample"@en ;

sosa-core:Actuation
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "An Actuation carries out an (actuation) Procedure to change the state of the world via an Actuator."@en ;
  rdfs:label "Actuation"@en ;

sosa-core:Actuator
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "A device that is used by, or implements, an (actuating) Procedure. Actuators change the state of the world."@en ;
  rdfs:label "Actuator"@en ;
.
sosa-core:Procedure
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "A workflow, protocol, plan, algorithm, or computational method specifying how to set up an Observation, take a Sample, or make a change to the state of the world (via an Actuator). A Procedure is re-usable, and might be involved in many observations, samplings, or actuations. It explains the steps to be carried out to arrive at reproducible results. Put differently, millions of observations may be created via the same Procedure the same way as millions of tables are assembled using the same instructions (as information objects, not their concrete realization). "@en ;
  rdfs:label "Procedure"@en ;
.
sosa-core:FeatureOfInterest
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "The feature whose ObservableProperty is being observed by a Sensor to arrive at a Result. For example, when measuring the height of a tree, said height is the ObservedProperty, 20m may be the Result of the Observation, and the tree is the FeatureOfInterest. "@en ;
  rdfs:label "Feature Of Interest"@en ;
.
sosa-core:Platform
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "A device, (computational) system, or agent (including humans). A platform carries at least one Sensor, Actuator, or sampling device to produce observations, actuations, or samples, by following a Procedure. In case of virtual sensors, a platform can be a computing system which hosts software implementations, e.g., simulations."@en ;
  rdfs:label "Platform"@en ;
.
sosa-core:Result
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "The result of an observation, actuation, or sampling, e.g., the value for on observed property of some feature of interest such as 20m for the height of a tree."@en ;
